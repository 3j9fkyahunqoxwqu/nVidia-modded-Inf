### nVidia modded Inf project created 2017 by CHEF-KOCH under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v3.


Easy installation:
===================


* Download and extract the Driver (download from official source) - wait until the installer has unzipped the files e.g. to C:\Nvidia
* Search "nv_disp.cat" (or corresponding file) in 'Display.Driver Folder'
* Follow the Video instruction to install the certificate
* Now you can install all my modded drivers, without disabling 'driver signature enforcement' in Windows.



ToDo:
======


* Add video
* Add more instruction and project details in Readme.md
