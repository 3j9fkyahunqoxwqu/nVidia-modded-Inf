## Non-Validated FreeSync Monitors with GeForce Cards

At CES 2019, NVIDIA announced that it was going to support Adaptive Sync monitors that passed its certification process. 

Out of over 400 tested monitors, only 12 were deemed "G-SYNC Compatible." NVIDIA has created a display at CES 2019 to highlight issues that non-validated FreeSync monitors may exhibit. 

Nvidia officially says that not all FreeSync monitors are created equal (!) and only 12 out of more than 400 are certified to be G-Sync-compatible.

## How do I turn it on?

`For VRR monitors yet to be validated as G-SYNC Compatible, a new NVIDIA Control Panel option will enable owners to try and switch the tech on - it may work, it may work partly, or it may not work at all.`
