* You need 10xx or 20xx series Nvidia GPU. 9xx series or anything older, at the time of writing, does not work! There is currently no workaround.
* Windows 10 because Windows 7/8/8.1 will not work.
* Own a Freesync compatible monitor -- this does not have to be on the list of 'Nvidia Certified' ones, it just has to support Freesync.
* Your Freesync monitor has to have DisplayPort 1.2+. Any HDMI implementation of Freesync will not work at this time, even if the monitor does technically support Freesync.
* It currently only works with one Monitor, if you have more than one Monitor plugged in it will not work.
* [Install driver 417.71](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/nVidia-modded-Inf/releases/tag/0.96) or higher.
* [G-Sync Pendulum Demo](https://us.download.nvidia.com/downloads/cool_stuff/demos/Setup_G-SYNC_1.13.exe)
