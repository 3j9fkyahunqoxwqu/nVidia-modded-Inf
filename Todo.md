Overview
======

- [ ] Add video or Add 'how to install driver manually' + video? (?)
- [ ] Add more instruction and project details in Readme.md 
- [x] Mention DDU
- [x] ~~Add manual 'create own inf' section + selfsign~~
- [x] ~~Add Devise Id list~~
- [x] ~~Add branch list~~
- [x] I only support win x64 modded infs, do not ask for 7, 8 or x86 versions!
- [x] ~~Fix the markdown~~
- [x] Add crap free setup.exe under Release? Need to ask GitHub in order to not get trouble.
- [ ] Removal.png needs to be updated in order to address latest drivers and their folders.
- [ ] Maybe add nvidia flash guide (short one) and explain how to adjust inf (low-prio) cause flashing is dead since there is no tool anymore for 1xx, 11xx cards and there might never will be one due protection mechanism. Modding is uninteresting without working tools.
